                <h3 id="story-title">Our Brand Story</h3>
                <p>AutoRush Retro was born from a shared passion for the golden age of automobiles, those iconic machines of the 20th century that defined a generation. It all started in a small garage in Barrie, Canada, where our founder, Patrick, spent countless nights restoring a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle. That car wasn’t just metal, it was a time capsule, a beautiful story on wheels. Patrick’s love for it sparked a dream: to bring these forgotten treasures back to life and share them with the world.</p>
                <p>Soon, the mission grew into a thriving enterprise when he teamed up with his close buddies Ethan and Jayden, two engineers with eyes for design and reputations for tracking down rare gems across the globe. Together, they scoured junkyards, auctions, and dusty garages from Detroit to Düsseldorf, from Tokyo to Cape Town unearthing classics like the Shelby Cobra, Peugeot 504, and Ford Cortina. Each car they saved carried a unique history. In time, Autorush became more than a dealership; it became a sanctuary for these stories, a place where the past drives back to life.</p>
                <p>Our experiences shaped who we are. We’ve learned to listen to the engine, to feel the soul of a car through its worn leather seats. Every dent and every polish is a chapter we’re proud to preserve. Today, AutoRush Retro stands as a testament to our love for these vehicles and the people who cherish them as much as we do.</p>
